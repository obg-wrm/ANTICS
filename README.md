How can we use imaging to improve measurements of organic carbon storage in the ocean?

Herein lies computationally relevant information to the ANTICS project. With state-of-the-art camera systems and the implementation
of novel data analysis techniques, we plan to better understand how organic particles behave in the interior ocean. We will investigate
size, distribution and composition of organic particles; make measurements of particle sinking velocities; develop techniques to translate
images of particles into flux data; elucidate how biogeochemical processes (remineralisation, aggregation/disaggregation, and
zooplankton fragmentation/repackaging) impact flux attenuation.
